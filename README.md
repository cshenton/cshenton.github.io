# cshenton.github.io

Source for my github.io site. This is a simple boids implementation in Typescript.

I originally wrote this when learning JS properly for the first time, to see if I could get reasonably good cache
coherency by sticking to native arrays in JS. This is a typescript rewrite of that original code.
